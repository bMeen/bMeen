I‚Äôm especially excited about building **reusable component libraries** or improving user experiences with **advanced UI/UX techniques**. I‚Äôm also open to contributing to **open-source projects** or teams where I can bring my expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks and learn from others.

üå± **Currently learning:**  
- Creating dynamic animations using libraries like **Framer Motion** and **GSAP**.  
- Deepening my knowledge in **SSR** with **Next.js** for faster and more optimized web apps.  
- Exploring **Supabase** and **Firebase** for seamless authentication, databases, and real-time data integration.  
- Delving into testing with **Jest** and **Cypress** to ensure applications are **reliable** and **maintainable**.

üí¨ **Let‚Äôs chat about:**  
I love talking about anything related to **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**! Whether it‚Äôs about **component-based architectures**, **performance optimization** with SSR, or managing **global state** in large applications, I‚Äôm happy to share my insights.
