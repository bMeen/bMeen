## Hi there 👋
💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m focused on building scalable, high-performance web applications using React, Next.js, and TypeScript. My current projects emphasize creating responsive and intuitive user interfaces while implementing best practices in modern frontend development. I’m also exploring ways to enhance performance through server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) with Next.js.
👯 I’m eager to collaborate on frontend projects that involve React, Next.js, or TypeScript, especially those focused on building reusable component libraries or improving user experience through advanced UI/UX techniques. I’m also open to contributing to open-source projects or teams where I can bring my expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks and learn from others.
🌱 I’m diving deep into animations using libraries like Framer Motion and GSAP to create engaging, dynamic web experiences. I’m also expanding my knowledge in server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js to build faster and more optimized web applications. Additionally, I’m exploring backend services like Supabase and Firebase for integrating seamless authentication, databases, and real-time data in my projects. Finally, I’m delving into testing tools like Jest and Cypress to ensure my applications are reliable and maintainable.
💬 I love talking about anything related to React, Next.js, and TypeScript! Whether it’s about building component-based architectures, optimizing performance with SSR, or handling global state in large applications, I’m always happy to share my experiences and insights. I’m also passionate about UI design systems, component libraries, and improving user experience through responsive, accessible design.
⚡ Fun fact: I transitioned into tech after studying something completely different! It wasn’t an easy journey, but learning front-end development turned out to be both challenging and fun. Now, I’m constantly experimenting with new libraries and frameworks to keep learning and growing.
